# Scrabble App (Next.js + Socket.IO client)

Frontend for the Scrabble-like multiplayer game.

## Quick start

```bash
cd scrabble-app
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000, enter a name and game ID (like `demo`), and click "Join Game".

Open another browser window with the same game ID to play with yourself and test turns, scoring, and chat.
